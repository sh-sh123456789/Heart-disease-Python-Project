# Heart-disease-Python-Project
Heart Disease Prediction Using Python  This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using the Heart Disease dataset, which includes features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate. The goal is to build a machine learning model for accurate heart disease prediction based on these medical indicators.
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Heart Disease Dataset** from Kaggle. It contains various medical attributes that help predict heart disease.

You can access the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

# Analysis and Visualizations

. Explored the dataset to check for missing values and understand feature structure. 
. Visualized feature distributions (age, cholesterol, heart rate) using histograms and box plots.
. Created a correlation heatmap to identify key feature relationships.
. Analyzed class distribution of heart disease labels (positive vs. negative).
