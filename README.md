# Heart-disease-Python-Project
Heart Disease Prediction Using Python  This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using the Heart Disease dataset, which includes features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate. The goal is to build a machine learning model for accurate heart disease prediction based on these medical indicators.
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Heart Disease Dataset** from Kaggle. It contains various medical attributes that help predict heart disease.

You can access the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

# Analysis and Visualizations

•	Explored missing values and data distribution. 

•	Visualized key features (age, cholesterol, max heart rate) using histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.

•	Investigated the correlation between features and the likelihood of heart disease.

# Machine Learning Model
•	Model Type: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.

•	Performance: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

•	Evaluation: Performance evaluated through confusion matrix and cross-validation.
